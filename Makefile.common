# -*- Makefile -*-

# This is a common Makefile that can be used as the core buildsystem for
# projects providing a library and some executables using this library. Simple example:
#
#
#    PROJECT_NAME := gltk
#    ABI_VERSION  := 0
#    TAIL_VERSION := 1
#
#    LIB_SOURCES := Gltk_Fl_Window.cc gltk.c gltk_control.c gltk_plot.c gltk_test_cmdline.c
#    BIN_SOURCES := gltk_test.cc
#
#    CCXXFLAGS += -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-unused-but-set-variable
#
#    LDLIBS := -lfltk -lfltk_gl -lGL -lGLU -lglut
#
#    DIST_BIN_EXCEPT     := *_test
#    DIST_INCLUDE_EXCEPT := *_test_*
#
#
#    include /usr/include/mrbuild/Makefile.common
#    -include *.d
#

# So we define some variables to set up our project, and the thing works. This
# is a plain Makefile, so things that work in plain Makefiles work here. You can
# define your own rules, dependencies and variables. Things like per-target
# variables should work.
#
# Variables that MUST be defined:
#
#     PROJECT_NAME  The name of the project. Ends up in the SONAME. Libraries
#                   may or may not be called lib..., but the "lib" will be
#                   prepended to the SONAME if it's missing
#
#     ABI_VERSION   An integer indicating the version of the ABI. Usually the
#                   same as the major version number of the project. Together
#                   with TAIL_VERSION, these define the default
#                     VERSION ?= $(ABI_VERSION).$(TAIL_VERSION)
#                   which can be used in the per-project Makefile
#
#     TAIL_VERSION  An arbitrary string. Together with TAIL_VERSION, these
#                   define the default
#                       VERSION ?= $(ABI_VERSION).$(TAIL_VERSION)
#                   which can be used in the per-project Makefile
#
#
# Variables that MAY be defined:
#
#     VERSION       A version string is always passed as a #define to the
#                   compiler, to all documentation generators (gengetopt and
#                   such). The project Makefile can set this to whatever they
#                   like. If omitted, it defaults to
#                       VERSION ?= $(ABI_VERSION).$(TAIL_VERSION)

#     LIB_SOURCES   Sources to build into a library. If undefined, all C and C++
#                   sources in src/ are taken. May contain wildcards.
#
#     BIN_SOURCES   Sources to build into executables. By default each executable
#                   will be built from the library and each source in
#                   BIN_SOURCES. If undefined, all C and C++ sources in bin/ are
#                   taken. May contain wildcards..
#
#     CFLAGS	    Flags for C, C++, the preprocessor and both respectively. By
#     CXXFLAGS	    default we pass -O3 and (for C++) -std=c++0x. If we specify
#     CCXXFLAGS	    any other optimization level or standard, the defaults will
#     CPPFLAGS      be omitted. To make commandline-based options work, touch
#                   these with +=
#
#     LDFLAGS       Similar to the above. The linker flags
#
#     LDLIBS        Similar to the above. The libraries we link with. By default this
#                   applies to all objects, libraries and executables we build
#
#     DIST_BIN      Executables that we distribute. May include wildcards. If omitted,
#                   defaults to all the executables $(BIN_SOURCES) produce
#
#     DIST_INCLUDE  Headers that we distribute. May include wildcards.. If omitted,
#                   defaults to all headers in . and include/
#
#     DIST_BIN_EXCEPT      Simple distribution blacklists. May include wildcards. For
#     DIST_INCLUDE_EXCEPT  anything fancier, use the ..._FINDSPEC variables described
#                          below
#
#     DIST_DOC      Documentation we ship. May include wildcards.
#
#     DIST_MAN      Man-pages we ship. May include wildcards.
#
#     DIST_DATA     Arbitrary data we ship. May include wildcards.
#
#     DIST_BIN_EXCEPT_FINDSPEC
#     DIST_INCLUDE_EXCEPT_FINDSPEC
#     DIST_DOC_EXCEPT_FINDSPEC
#     DIST_MAN_EXCEPT_FINDSPEC
#     DIST_DATA_EXCEPT_FINDSPEC
#                   After we install a set of files to the DESTDIR, we may want
#                   to delete some subset of them. This is similar to the
#                   _EXCEPT blacklists above, but accomplished with the 'find'
#                   utility, so we have more flexibility. For instance, to
#                   install all the manpages except onces for tests, do this:
#
#                     DIST_MAN                 := doxygen-doc/man/man3
#                     DIST_MAN_EXCEPT_FINDSPEC := -type f -name '*_test.3'
#
#                   To install only the manpage for the frobnicator utility
#                   (delete all others) we do this:
#
#                     DIST_MAN                 := doxygen-doc/man/man3
#                     DIST_MAN_EXCEPT_FINDSPEC := -type f \! \( -name 'frobnicator.3' \)
#
#     EXTRA_CLEAN   Additional target to clean out during a 'make clean'
